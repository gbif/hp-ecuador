## Arriving in Canberra

### About Canberra

Canberra is the capital of Australia and occupies part of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), in south-eastern Australia; Canberra is situated inland between the cities of Sydney and Melbourne. Canberra was founded as the Capital City of Australia, and the seat of Australian Government in 1913.  

![Canberra, photo by Freesally from Pixabay](/assets/images/Canberra.jpg){:standalone}

Canberra is located on the lands of the Ngunnawal people, the Indigenous people of this region and the traditional owners of the land on which we will meet. 

### Canberra by plane 
 
There are no direct international flights into Canberra and your first Australian destination will be either Melbourne Tullamarine<sup>1</sup> or Sydney Kingsford Smith. Canberra is about a one-hour flight from either of these airports.  

For members attending the TDWG Conference in Hobart, there are flights from Hobart to Canberra (via Melbourne or Sydney).  

It is about a 10-minute drive from the airport to the city centre.  

*(<sup>1</sup> Melbourne international is the easiest airport to arrive into as the domestic terminal is in the same building; in Sydney you will be required to transfer by bus from the international terminal to the domestic terminal.)*  

### Canberra by train/bus
There are two [train](https://transportnsw.info/routes/details/regional-coaches/631/76631) services per day and several [bus](https://www.murrays.com.au/express-services/) services per day from Sydney to Canberra. Trains leave from [Central Station](https://www.sydneymetro.info/station/central-station) in Sydney and arrive at [Canberra Railway Station, Kingston](https://goo.gl/maps/7fRCu4ofzSjmT3Cb6), travel time approximately 4 hours; bus services pick up and drop off at the domestic and international terminals at Kingsford Smith Airport and arrive at [Jolimont Tourist Centre](https://goo.gl/maps/zBfX4XKeAHw63Frv9) in the city, travel time approximately 3 hours.

## Getting around in Canberra

### On arrival at Canberra Airport
There is a dedicated taxi rank for flight arrivals outside the baggage collection area at Canberra airport to transport you to your accommodation. Ubers are also readily available on arrival at Canberra airport.  

### In Canberra
Getting around Canberra is quick, affordable and easy with its various taxi cabs and ride sharing services. Most attractions and things to see and do are located very close to each other.  

Hiring an e-scooter is another great way to get around the city and surrounds. [Beam](https://visitcanberra.com.au/hire/5f9f8badeb104fa77f934973/beam-scooter) and [Neuron](https://visitcanberra.com.au/hire/5f9f83eb7e6c235463cf6442/neuron-scooter), hire out e-scooters with helmets. Road rules and conditions apply so make sure you familiarise yourself with these before you ride.  

Canberra has an extensive network of cycle paths and dedicated bike lanes on our main roads making cycling an easy way to get around the city. There are many options available for [hiring a bike](https://visitcanberra.com.au/articles/how-to-hire-a-bike-in-canberra) in Canberra.  

The [Neighbourhood Guide](https://visitcanberra.com.au/traveller-information/guides-to-canberra) Canberra City provides lots of information on restaurants, shopping, and cultural experiences in the Inner North including the city, Acton and Braddon.

The majority of payments in Australia are made with cards, however it is always a good idea to have some Australian dollars in cash. You will find some vendors who will only accept cash.  

Travel money guide: [Australia](https://www.finder.com/travel-money/australia)

Almost all shops accept cash, credit cards and debit cards.  

Most goods in Australia are subject to 10% GST (goods & services tax). This includes things bought in shops as well as dining out. The only exemptions are fresh food such as milk, bread etc. All prices listed include tax, so you should never have to pay more than the advertised price.
