# The general format for these compositions is a list of blocks. Each block has a type and some data that is used by the block template.
# See more examples at https://hp-theme.gbif-staging.org/layout/compose
composition:
- type: heroImage # The type is a template. In this case  a big splashy image with some text on it. The data defines what the image is and what the text is. 
  # data: compose.someFile.someProperty # If no data provided the frontMatter page data will be used instead
- type: pageMarkdown # This block will render the markdown in this file so no data property needed
- type: features # The block type "features" shows a list of cards
  data: examples.couldBeAnyName # We also need some data for those cards. In this case we refer to a yaml file in the _data folder.
- type: split
  data: examples.someOtherNameForSomeData
- type: media # another block type, but this time defining the data inline, instead of in a separate file
